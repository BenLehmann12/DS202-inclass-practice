```

## Logic operations

For a given vector $a = (1, 15, 3, 20, 5, 8, 9, 10, 1, 3)$,
```{r}
library(classdata)
library(ggplot2)

a = c(1, 15, 3, 20, 5, 8, 9, 10, 1, 3)
```

1. less than 20

```{r}
a < 20
```

2. squared value is at least 100 or less than 10

```{r}
(a^2 >= 100) | (a^2 < 10)
a^2
```


3. equals 1 or 3

```{r}
(a == 1) | (a == 3)
a %in% c(1, 3)
```

4. even

```{r}
a
(a %% 2) == 0
((a / 2) - floor(a / 2)) == 0
```

## "filter" function

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

A1 = dplyr::filter(fbi, year == 2014, state == "Iowa")
```
